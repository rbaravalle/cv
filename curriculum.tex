\section*{\color{niceblue} \rule{2cm}{2.2pt} About}

\begin{small}
\noindent
PhD in Computer Science with experience in image and geometry processing, robotics, computer graphics, deep learning and computer vision, among others.
I have scientific publications in these fields as well as more than twelve years of working experience in the industry.
I am fluent in Spanish (native), English (IELTS-C1) and French (Delf B2). Having worked in different countries and work environments (public and private sector), I am a team player who easily adapts to new challenges. I am interested in joining an international team that allows me to expand my knowledge while providing my experience and expertise.
