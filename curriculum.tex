\section*{\color{niceblue} \rule{2cm}{2.2pt} About}

\begin{small}
\noindent
With a PhD in Computer Science and over sixteen years of industry experience, I possess a multifaceted skillset in image and geometry processing, robotics, computer graphics, deep learning, and computer vision. My expertise is backed by scientific publications and impactful contributions. Fluency in Spanish (native), English (IELTS-C1), and French (Delf B2) enables seamless communication and collaboration across diverse teams. Having thrived in various countries and sectors, I am a highly adaptable team player, demonstrated by successfully leading a cross-functional team of 20+ people to implement new robotic cleaning algorithms and platforms. I am eager to join an international team where I can leverage my extensive knowledge and experience to drive innovation and contribute to meaningful research advancements.
